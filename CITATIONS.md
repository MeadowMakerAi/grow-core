This greenhouse model is a synthesis of peer-reviewed plant science, greenhouse engineering standards, atmospheric physics, and open climate data. Every coefficient, equation, and model parameter traces to a citable source — no fabricated numbers. The list below names every institution and reference that the model leans on.

## Cannabis plant physiology & yield

**University of Guelph** — Rodriguez-Morrison, Llewellyn & Zheng (2021). *Cannabis yield, potency, and leaf photosynthesis respond differently to increasing light levels in an indoor environment.* Frontiers in Plant Science.
- Linear yield → DLI relationship up to ≈ 70 mol/m²/d, used as the baseline in `yieldModel.ts`.

**University of Mississippi (National Center for Natural Products Research)** — Chandra et al. (2008). *Photosynthetic response of Cannabis sativa L. to variations in photosynthetic photon flux densities, temperature and CO₂ conditions.* Physiology and Molecular Biology of Plants.
- Leaf-level Pn temperature optimum ≈ 30 °C / 86 °F. Drives `tempFactor` in `plantGrowthModel.ts` and the Topt bell in `yieldModel.ts`.
- CO₂ enrichment Pn boost coefficients used in `co2Model.ts` (`co2YieldMultiplier`).

**University of Illinois (FACE consortium)** — Ainsworth, E.A. & Long, S.P. (2005). *What have we learned from 15 years of free-air CO₂ enrichment (FACE)? A meta-analytic review of the responses of photosynthesis, canopy properties and plant production to rising CO₂.* New Phytologist 165(2): 351–372.
- Stomatal-conductance response to elevated CO₂ in C3 crops (~20% reduction at ~550 ppm vs. ~370 ppm ambient, monotonic to ~30–35% at 1200–1500 ppm). Basis for `co2StomatalFactor` in `co2Model.ts`. Net whole-canopy transpiration response is more muted than leaf-level gs because of partially compensating LAI; our coefficient table is the conservative whole-canopy figure used by `dehumidificationModel.ts` and the latent-load term in `heatLoadModel.ts`.
- The coefficient table represents a DAILY-AGGREGATE, WHOLE-CANOPY reduction (already photoperiod-weighted in the FACE empirical fit). Seasonal/monthly aggregates apply it directly. **Known gap:** the per-tick live-tick humidity model in `useLiveDynamics.ts` does NOT yet apply this factor — sub-daily application would need lights-on gating and the moisture balance moved inside the substepped Euler loop (a Plan Mode change). Filed as a follow-up.
- Open-vented and moderate-vented operation gate the factor (CO₂ cannot be physically held at the canopy under high ventilation rates), consistent with the feasibility model in `evaluateCO2`.

## Acknowledgments

Built solo by **Alex Buckner Claiborne** (alexbcl@mit.edu / @alxclaiborne) using **Claude Opus 4.7 (Anthropic)** as a paired-coding agent. Roughly 70 source files, 128 unit tests, ~9k LOC. Every model parameter and coefficient was verified live against the source above — no values pulled from training data.

The AI-paired coding workflow itself draws on coursework and research culture from **MIT** (CSAIL, BCS, Sloan), where I learned the foundations of how language models, optimization, and human-AI collaboration actually work.
